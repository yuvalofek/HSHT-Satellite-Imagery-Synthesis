# HSHT-Satellite-Imagery-Synthesis
Code used **Improving Flood Maps by Increasing the Temporal Resolution of Satellites Using Hybrid Sensor Fusion - Video Interpolation Networks**


### The work is heavily based on: 
* Pix2pix from: https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
* FLAVR from: https://github.com/tarun005/FLAVR

### Rough Idea:
We propose the combination of video frame interpolation on a single satellite and cross satellite sensor fusion via image-to-image translation as a means of creating higher spatial higher temporal imagery. 

To do this, we first modified FLAVR and Pix2pix to handle satellite imagery.
